# Luzifer / ulauncher-autotype

This [Ulauncher](https://ulauncher.io/) extensions is a simple wrapper around `xdotool type [...]`.

If you encounter an application or field you are not allowed to paste stuff into, let your X-Server do the typing for you:

- Get an Ulauncher input field
- Type `at <paste your buffer>`
- Watch the content getting typed into the window
- Profit
